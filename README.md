# Hand-tracking-3D-gun-controller
Hand-tracking controlled FPS, aiming with 3D printed gun and Arduino

## IT IS NOT FINISHED!
This project is yet to be finished. 

## About the project
As a younger sister of older brother who was skilled with computers and preoccupied with games, I often found myself immersed in the game world he is navigating through. Over the time, his enthusiasm became contagious and I found myself going from a spectator to a player.

Counter Strike 1.6 is one of the first games we ever played, and back in 2012, it was extremly popular in the Balkans, especially because its multiplayer mode played a key role in the development of gaming caf√©s which became regular hubs for gamers and friends. 


Fast forward to today, I am playing Counter Strike 2.0, thinking how could I make this game even more fun? I've decided to program to play it from afar, your hand controlling the mouse and Arduino, which has both button and joystick, to shoot and move around. To make experience more unique I am 3D printing a custom gun with the Arduino embedded inside it.

## About the code
Initally, I have written a program where the computer recognizes your hand and its movements, syncing them with the mouse. If you move your hand or make fist gesture, the cursor behaves according to the code - it either moves or clicks. 

## Libraries and technologies used
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Arduino Nano
- Button, joystick, breadboard, resistor, jumper wires
